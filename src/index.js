 * Lexical binding for this
 *      1. Implicit binding
 *      2. Explicit binding
 *      3. Hard binding
 *      4. Auto binding
 *      5. arrow functions and this
 *
 * call, apply, bind
 *
 * Object creation
 *      1. Literal
 *      2. Factory function with Object.create()
 *      3. Constructor function with new
 *      4. class with new
 *
 * Prototype and __proto__
 *      1. Difference
 *
 * class
 *      1. constructor
 *      2. instance properties
 *      3. static properties
 *      4. methods
 *              1. prototype methods
 *              2. generator methods
 *              3. static methods
 *              2. generator methods
 *      5. field declaration
 *              1. public field
 *              2. private field
 *
 * Prototypal inheritance
 *      1. Using factory functions
 *      2. Using constructor function and new
 *      1. Using class, extends, super and new
 *
 * extends and super
 * Object static methods
 * Object.prototype methods
 * Operators and Loop construct
 * Gotchas and questions
 *      1. why is it important to reset the constructor of the prototype after linking it to another class?
 *      2. What is the difference in creating prototyp chain using Object.create() vs new?? Very important
 *              child.prototype = Object.create(parent.prototype)
 *              child.prototype = new Parent();
 *      3. What is the difference between Object.prototype.isPrototypeOf() and instanceof operator
 *      4. How isPrototypeOf and instanceof can be used together?
 *      5. Different methods to check if property is available directly on object
 *      6. Different methods to check if property is available directly on object + up the prototype chain
 *      7. Different methods to check if an object is a descendent of a constructor function
